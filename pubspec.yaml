# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/map_style.txt
   - images/
  #  - images/greco.png
  #  - images/vet_prueba.jpg
  #  - images/veterinaria.png
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Proypet
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Proypet.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
        #   style: italic
    - family: IconProypet
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/IconProypet.ttf
    # - family: Lato
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/Lato/Lato-Regular.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Lato/Lato-Bold.ttf
    #       weight: 700
    # - family: PT Sans
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/PT_Sans/PTSans-Regular.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/PT_Sans/PTSans-Bold.ttf
    #       weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
